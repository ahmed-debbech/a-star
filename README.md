# A* Pathfinding Implementation & Visualisation
This is a very experimental work of a visualisation for A Star pathfinding algorithm to learn it and do some tweaks with it.

## TODO
**Part I:** \
We will start by implmenting Dijkstra's algorithm (i know that's not A star)\
**Part II:** \
Then we modify the algo to turn it out to A Star Pathfinding algorithm. \
**Part III:** \
To make all this visual we should use a library on top to provide the visuals. \
And this will probably be SFML.

## I'm just saying that:
I want to make this work just to feel like i achieved/learnt something new :) \
