# A* Pathfinding Implementation & Visualisation
This is a very experimental work of a visualisation for A Star pathfinding algorithm to learn it and do some tweaks with it.

## How to run?
1- Clone the repo in local \
2- 'cd' to the root directory of the folder \
3- 'make' command will compile \
4- './prog' will execute. 
## TODO
**Part I:** \
We will start by implmenting Dijkstra's algorithm (i know that's not A star)\
We use here undirected graphs only. \
**Part II:** \
Then we modify the algo to turn it into A Star algorithm. \
**Part III:** \
To make all this visual we should use a library on top to provide the visuals. \
And this will probably be SFML.

## I'm just saying that:
I want to make this work just to feel like i achieved/learnt something new :)
